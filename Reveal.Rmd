# Research Question:

<section>

     <img src="strawberry.png"  height="180" width="250">
    </ul>  
- How has toxic chemical usage changed over time 
  
  and does this vary across different states?

# Especially in California

- California had 11 main Carcinogenic chemicals detected in strawberry yields.
- They fall into the known, possible and probable categories. 
- The figure below shows a scaled plot of the distribution of Carcinogens detected in strawberries in California over time.

# Probable carcinogenic chemicals

  Why Captan is still used as widely as it is if it is toxic?
